# SA-Pay ATM System
This project is a simple ATM simulation built with x86 assembly language, featuring:<br>
Account Creation: Set up an account with a name and PIN.<br>
View Statement: Check your account balance and details.<br>
Deposit Money: Add predefined amounts (e.g., 1000, 2000).<br>
Withdraw Money: Withdraw money if funds are sufficient.<br>
Exit: Safely close the system.<br>
The program is menu-driven, user-friendly, and includes error handling to ensure smooth operations. It demonstrates how assembly language can power practical applications like an ATM. <br>
